Building an ASR system using Whisper & Seamless-M4T, with the goal of creating a robust ASR system that could perform well even in low-resource settings, involving techniques like PEFT and model pruning. Also applied techniques ranging from data preprocessing, model optimization, real-time performance, and deploying the model on AWS. Achieving a solution with improved accuracy than the original model,  with reduction of computation requirements.
